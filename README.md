# Computer Systems Engineering, ITMO University, Second Year

I have started this repository at the beginning of my second year (2018-2019) of studying for a Bachelor's
in computer science at ITMO Univesity.

It is essentially a continuation of my [first year's collection](https://github.com/timlathy/itmo-first-year)
of assignment solutions, code snippets, and notes. I have decided against keeping everything under a single
repository because this year's curriculum has a different focus and a completely new set of core subjects.

This is very much a work in progress, and I will likely move some things around. In general, I place
course-related material in directories which names are in title case and reflect, well, the name of the course,
while miscellaneous items go into directories with lower case names.

If you find any of the notes or sources useful, you are free to copy and modify them as you see fit.
Do note that they are provided without any kind of warranty.
